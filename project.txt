Voice Scam Shield – Multilingual AI for Real-Time Call Scam Detection
Track: VC big bets (Cybersecurity)
1. Motivation / Goal to Achieve
Generative voice technology now enables scammers to impersonate friends, family, and institutions during live phone or video calls. Victims often realize too late, after sensitive information or money is lost.
Goal:
 Develop a multilingual AI agent that works during phone or video calls to:
Detect scam intent and synthetic voices in real time.


Alert the user with discreet on-call feedback.


Support English, Spanish, and French (bonus: add 1–2 more).


2. Core Features (MVP)
Real-Time Call Audio Monitoring


Integrate with Twilio, WebRTC, or Zoom SDK to capture live call audio.


Perform voice activity detection and speaker diarization to separate user from caller.


Multilingual Scam & Deepfake Detection


Streaming transcription (e.g., Whisper or Deepgram) → detect scam patterns with LLM prompts or trained classifiers.


Run anti-spoofing detection (AASIST or RawNet2) to identify synthetic voices.


Label segments as Safe, Suspicious, or Scam with short rationale.


On-Call User Alerts


Visual dashboard or floating widget showing live risk score.


Spoken alerts via ElevenLabs TTS to discreetly warn the user (“This call may be fraudulent. Do not share codes.”).


3. Stretch Goals (Optional Enhancements)
Caller Verification


Match the caller’s voice against a pre-enrolled “safe list” (family, known company reps).


Incident Report Generation


After the call, generate a summary with flagged segments, scam cues, and recommended next steps.


4. Hints and Resources
Frontend:
React or Next.js UI for live risk display and after-call reports.


Backend:
FastAPI for audio ingestion and detection pipeline; WebSockets for streaming.


Speech Stack:
ASR: Whisper, Vosk, or NVIDIA NeMo streaming ASR.


Anti-Spoofing: ASVspoof 2019/2021 datasets + AASIST baseline.


Scam Intent Detection: LLM (GPT-4o-mini) or multilingual transformer classifier.


TTS for Alerts:
ElevenLabs real-time TTS with multilingual voices.


Example Datasets:
ASVspoof (synthetic voice detection).


FakeAVCeleb / WaveFake (voice cloning samples).


Custom multilingual scam script dataset for intent classification.


5. Evaluation Criteria
Coverage: Works for phone and video calls; multilingual EN/ES/FR.
Detection Accuracy: ≥80% correct classification of scam vs safe calls.
Anti-Spoofing: ≤10% Equal Error Rate on synthetic voice detection.
Latency: Alerts within 2 seconds of suspicious speech.
User Experience: Clear, discreet alerts without disrupting the call.
6. Why It Matters
This challenge equips people with a real-time defense system against the new wave of AI-driven scam calls. It’s proactive, multilingual, and accessible—ideal for personal safety, corporate fraud prevention, and protecting vulnerable communities in the age of generative voice.
